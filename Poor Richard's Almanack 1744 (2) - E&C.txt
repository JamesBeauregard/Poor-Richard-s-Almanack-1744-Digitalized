Courteous Reader,
THIS is the Twelfth Year that I have in
this Way laboured for the Benefit - - - of
Whom ? - - - of the Publick, if you’ll be so
good-natured as to believe it ; if not, e'en take the
naked Truth, 'twas for the Benefit of my own dear
self ; not forgetting in the mean time, our gracious
Confort and Dutches the peaceful, quiet, silent
Lady Bridget. But whether my Labours have been
of any Service to the Publick or not, the Publick I
must acknowledge has been of Service to me ; I
have lived Comfortably by its Benevolent Encour-

Readers gratis in his Almanack for 1743 an Eclipse
of the Year 1744, to be beforehand with me : His
Words are, “ The first Day of April next Year
" 1-44, there will be a GREAT ECLIPSE
“ of the Sun ; it begins about an Hour before Sunset.
“ It being in the Sign Aries, the House of Mars,
“ and in the 7th, shows Heat, Difference and Ani-
" mosities between Persons of the highest Rank and
" Quality," &c. I am very glad, for the Sake of
these Persons of Rank and Quality, that there is
no manner of Truth in this Prediction : They may,
if they please, live in Love and Peace. And I
caution his Readers (they are but few, indeed,
and so the Matter's the less) not to give themselves
any Trouble about observing this imaginary Great
Eclipse; for they may stare till they re blind with-
out feeing the least Sign of it. I might, on this
Occasion, retur Mr. F - - - - - n the Name of Baal's
false Prophet he gave me some Years ago in his Wrath,
on Account of my Predicting his Reconciliation
with the Church of Rome, (tho' he ſeems now to have
given up that Point) bur I think such Language
between old Men and Scholars unbecoming; and
I leave him to settle the Affair with the Buyers of
