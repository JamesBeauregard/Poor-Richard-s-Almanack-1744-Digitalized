IX Mon. November hath xxx days.
Sylvia while young, with ev'ry Grace adorn'd,
Each blooming Youth, and fondest Lover scorn'd :
In Years at length arriv'd at Fifty-nine,
She feels Love's Passion as her Charms decline :
— Thus Oaks a hundred Winters old
Just as they now expire,
Turn Touchwood, doated, grey and old,
And at each SPARK take Fire. —
