V Mon. July hath xxxi days
All-conq'ring HEAT, oh intermit thy Wrath !
And on my throbbing Temples potent thus
Beam not so hard ! Incessant still you flow,
And still another fervent Flood succeeds,
Pour'd on the Head profuse. In vain I sigh,
And restless turn, and look around for Night ;
Night is far off ; and hotter Hours approach.
Who can endure! - - - -
