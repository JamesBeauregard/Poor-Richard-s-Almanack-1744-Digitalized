Explanation of this ALMANACK.
THE first Column shews the Days of the Month
The fecond shews the Week days, Sunday
Letter this Year being A G.
The third contains the Days observ'd by the
Church, the Aspects of the Planers and Judgments
of the Weather, rhe Length, Increase and Decrease
of Days, the rising and setting of the seven Stars, &.
The fourth is the Time of High Water at Phi-
ladelphia (h) signifies half an hour after.
The fifth is the Moon's Place.
The sixth is the Sun's rising and setting, thus un-
derstood; Against the second Day of January you
see in the 6th Column these Figures 7 17 5, which
show that the Sun rises that Day 17 Minutes after 7,
and sets 17 Minutes before 5. I have chose to put
the Sun's rising and setting for every Day, rather than
the Moon's, because of its constant Use in setting of
Clocks and Watches.
In the last Column, with the Changes of the
Moon, I have put her rising and setting every now
and then: If you want to know her rising or setting
on any Day between those against which I have
set it, the common Rule of three Quarters of an hour
later each Day, will be exact enough to direct Peo-
ple in their Travelling, which is the common Use
that is made ot ir.
