I am, dear Reader,
Thy obliged Friend,
R. SAUNDERS.
The COUNTRY Man.
Happy the Man whose With and Care
A few paternal Acres bound,
Content to breathe his native Air,
In his own Ground.
Whose Herds with Milk, whose Fields with Breads,
Whose Flocks supply him with Attire,
Whose Trees in Summer yield him Shade,
In Winter Fire.
Blest, who can unconcernedly find
Hours, Days, and Years slide soft away,
In Health of Body, Peace of Mind,
Quiet by Day,
Sound Sleep by Night ; Study and Ease
Together mixt ; sweet Recreation ;
And Innocence which most does lease
with Meditation,
Thus let me live, unseen, unknown,
Thus unlamented let me die,
Steal from the World, and not a Stone
Tell where I lie.
