ECLIPSES 1744.
THIS Year there will be four Eclipses, two
of the Sun and two of the Moon ; but nei-
ther of them will be visible here.
The First is an Eclipse of the Sun, the first Day
of April, at Five in the Afternoon ; but the Moon's
Latitude being 38 m. 42 sec. South, and alone,
without the Parralax, greater than the Semidiameter
of the Penumbra, 31 m. 38 sec. It cannot be
seen in this Part of the World.
The Second is an Eclipse of the Moon, on April
the 15th, at three in the Afternoon, therefore in-
visible here ; but will be visible almost over all
Europe, Asia, and Arica ; about 8 Digits when
greatest.
The Third is an Eclipse of the Sun, on the 24th
of September, at Eight in the Afternoon, therefore
not to be seen here ; but towards the North East
Parts of Tartary, it will be a great Eclipse.
The Fourth and last is an Eclipse ot the Moon,
on the 10th of October, at Eight in the Morning
but the Moon going down before the Eclipse be-
gins, it cannot be seen here ; but further to the
Westward, this Eclipse when greatest will be
visible five Digits and a half.
COURTS.
Two trav'ling Beggars, (I've forgot their Name)
On Oister found to which they both laid Claim.
Warm the Dispute ! At length to Law they'd go,
As richer Fools for Trifles often do.
The Cause two Betty-foggers undertake,
Resolving right or wrong some Gain to make.
They jangle till the Court this Judgment gave,
Determining what every one should have.
Blind Plaintiff, lame Defendant, Bare
The friendly Law's impartial Care :
A Shell for him, a Shell for thee :
The MIDDLE's Bench and Lawyer's Fee.
