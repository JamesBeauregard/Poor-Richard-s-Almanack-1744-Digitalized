VII Mon. September hath xxx days.
All other Good by Fortune's Hand are giv'n,
A WIFE is the peculiar Gift of Heav'n.
Vain Fortune's Favours, never at a Stay,
Like empty Shadows, pass, and glide away ;
One solid Comfort, our eternal Wife,
Abundantly Supplies us all our Life:
This Blessing lasts (if those that try say true)
As long as Heart can with - - - and longer too.
