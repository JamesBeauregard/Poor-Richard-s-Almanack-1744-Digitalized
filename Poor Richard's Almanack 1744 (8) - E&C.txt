XII Mon. February hath xxix days.
Our youthful Preacher fee, intent on Fame ;
Warm to gain Souls? — No, 'tis to gain a Name.
Behold his Hands display’d, his Body rais'd ;
With what a Zeal he labours - - -  to be prais'd.
Touch'd with each Weakness which he does arraign,
With Vanity he talks ag inst the Vain ;
Wich Ostentation does to Meekness guide ;
Proud of his Periods form'd to strike at Pride.
