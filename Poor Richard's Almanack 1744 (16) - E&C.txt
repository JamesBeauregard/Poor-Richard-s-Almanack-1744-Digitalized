VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.
Be Niggard's of Advice on no Pretence ;
For the worst Avarice is that of Sense.
Yet 'ris not all, your Counsel's free and true;
Blunt Truths more Mischief than nice Falshoods do.
Men must be taught as if you taught them nor,
And Things unknown propos'd as Things forgot ;
Without Good Breeding Truth is disapprov'd
That only makes superior Sense belov'd
