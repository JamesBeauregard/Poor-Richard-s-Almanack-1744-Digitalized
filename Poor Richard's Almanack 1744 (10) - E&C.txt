II Mon. April hath xxx days.
With what a pertect World-revolving Power
Were first the unweildy Planets launch 'd along
Th' illimitable Void ! Thus to remain
Amid the Flux of many thousand Years,
That oft has swept the buſy Race oſ Men,
And all their labour'd Monuments away :
Unresting, changeless, matchlefs, in their Course;
To Night and Day, with the delightful Round
Of Seasons, faithful, not eccentric once :
So pois'd, and perfect is the vast Machine !
