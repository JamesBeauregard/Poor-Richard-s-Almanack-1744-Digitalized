III Mon. May hath xxxi days.
Irus tho' wanting Gold and Lands,
Lives chearful, easy, and content ;
Corvus, unbless'd, with twenty Hands
Employ'd to count his yearly Rent.
Sages in Wisdom! tell me which
Ot these you think possesses more !
One with his Poverty is rich,
And one with all his Wealth is poor.
