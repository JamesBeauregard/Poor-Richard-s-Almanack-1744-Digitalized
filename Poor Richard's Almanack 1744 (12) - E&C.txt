IV Mon. June hath xxx days.
Of all the Causes which conspire to blind
Man's erring Judgment, and misguide the Mind,
What the weak Head with strongest Biass rules,
Is Pride, that never-failing Vice of Fools.
Whatever Nature has in Worth deny'd,
She gives in large Recruits of needful Pride ;
For as in Bodies, thus in Souls we find
What wants in Blood & Spirits, swell'd with Wind.
