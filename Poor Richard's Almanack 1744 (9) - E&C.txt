I Mon. March hath xxxi days.
Without Repentance none to Heav'n can go,
Yet what Repentance is few seem to know :
"Tis not to cry out Mercy, or to sit
And droop, or to confess that thou hast fail'd ;
'Tis to bewail the Sins thou didst commit,
And not commit those Sins thou hast bewail'd.
He that bewails, and not forsakes them too,
Confesses rather what he means to do.
