I chose to record the metadata I did because I wanted to prioritize the most important data and data that could be recorded with minimal interpretation, as information through that interpretation could potentially lose meaning. The metadata I did not record, I think, can be left up to the interpretation of others, for the viewing of others in general, and can easily be seen that does. For example, I did not record that each page had staining on it, as it was common for every page and if someone looked at the pages, they could easily tell there was some kind of dark staining on the pages. Normally, I would think to document this kind of observation, but in a digital edition, that includes photos of the pages, the readers can tell on their own. I also made sure to include information about the almanack that could not be directly seen through its digital edition, in order to add more to its character and understanding as a material that can be studied and understood. Also, I think it is important to note that I did not translate or transcribe and wording because the text is readable via the online documents and did not seem to require transcribing. This would also help with mitigating the risk of mistranslation in the final dataset.
