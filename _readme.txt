I chose to record the metadata I did because I wanted to prioritize the most important data and data that could be recorded with minimal interpretation, as information through that interpretation could potentially lose meaning. The metadata I did not record, I think, can be left up to the interpretation of others, for the viewing of others in general, and can easily be seen that does. For example, I did not record that each page had staining on it, as it was common for every page and if someone looked at the pages, they could easily tell there was some kind of dark staining on the pages. Normally, I would think to document this kind of observation, but in a digital edition, that includes photos of the pages, the readers can tell on their own. I also made sure to include information about the almanack that could not be directly seen through its digital edition, in order to add more to its character and understanding as a material that can be studied and understood. Also, I think it is important to note that I did not translate or transcribe and wording because the text is readable via the online documents and did not seem to require transcribing. This would also help with mitigating the risk of mistranslation in the final dataset.

Summary of Extraction and Cleaning: 10/20/25
For the extraction and cleaning of my text, I used Transkribus, which uses HTR technology. The HTR was, for the most part, accurate. Still, it consistently had mistakes in the transcription of the text. Most of the mistakes, however, were due to the fact that the text had many symbols involved, which do not easily transcribe. Also, the way the letter "s" was written throughout the entire text looked very close to an "f" because most of the "s" letters were written as long "s" letters, so it confused the AI translation. So, there was a decent amount of correcting to do, because I had to fix all of the "s" letters in the text as well as the mistranslated text. Another important aspect of the AI translation was that the text ink was sometimes smeared a little bit or completely, leaving tiny gaps in the words. This led to a lot of correcting to be done for interpreting words in the text. One of the hardest aspects of extracting and cleaning this text was that there were many table-like structures of data that had symbols that were not easily accessible and would take a very long time to figure out the symbols and translate them. So, I decided that the best course of action for the extraction of the text was to keep the table-like structure as a photo/picture, so there is no loss of data in translation. That was the main problem that I ran into with this text when it came to tables and images. Sometimes the text would not be written in a left-to-right format, like normal writing, and that required some thinking on the extraction and cleaning of the data. So, whenever the pages, for example, were divided into 2 vertical columns, I followed the correct progression of reading based on how it was written. So, I followed the intended order of reading when copying and correcting the text. Overall, the extraction and cleaning of the text was done mainly by first grouping the text in its different sections, making sure the proper text was underlined for the data, correcting the writing with respect to the original text (translation) and finally making sure the text is represented as originally as possible, so that nothing assumed is done where metadata can be lost. So, I can see how different types of media introduce problems, not only in translation but in work, becoming very time-consuming and intricate, and how the nuances become very important to think about when cleaning and extracting a text from a document, especially comparing its physical version and online version.
