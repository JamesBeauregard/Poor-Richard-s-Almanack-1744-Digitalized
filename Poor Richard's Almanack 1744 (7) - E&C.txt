XI Mon. January hath xxi days.
Biblis does Solitude admire,
A wond'rous Lover of the Dark ;
Each Night puts out her Chamber-Fire,
And just keeps in a single Spark ;
'Till four she keeps herſelt alive,
Warm’d by her Piety, no doubt ;
Then, tir'd with kneeling, just at five,
She sighs— and lets that Spark go out.
