IV Mon. August hath xxxi days.
Wouid Men bnt follow what the Sex advise,
All things would prosper, all the World grow wise.
'Twas by Rebecca's Aid that Jacob won
His Father's Blessing from an elder Son.
Abusive Nabal ow'd his forfeit Life.
To the wise Conduct of a prudent Wife,
At Hester's Suit, the persecuting Sword
Was sheath'd, and Israel liv'd to bless the Lord.
